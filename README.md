Legend-Of-Aiopa-II
==================
The far superior and efficient version of the Legend Of Aiopa text based adventure.

Now, most of the script is saved in the adventureCore.py file, ready to be called and run by another python file.

The api is based around lists of tuples. All the objects in a certain room or dungeon are store in a list, with additional information about said items stored within tuples.
